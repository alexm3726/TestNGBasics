Assertions

    Hard Assertions-
        If assertions found an error, our code will stop and
        the rest of the code will not run and will throw an exception

    Soft Assertions-
        It allows you us to execute our entire code and shows the result of all
        the failures in a report

        We use assertAll() to collect all the failures in the end.
